# Pulse: Universal Energy Management System

![Smart Home UI](misc/frontend_goal.png)

## Overview

The **Universal Energy Management System (UEMS)** is a smart home energy management interface that connects IoT and non-IoT devices to a centralized console. The front page is designed to provide an intuitive and interactive user experience, allowing users to monitor and optimize their energy consumption efficiently.

This repository contains the **frontend** and **backend** components of the UEMS dashboard. The system provides real-time energy tracking, smart device control, and an **optimization model** to minimize electricity costs.

## System Architecture

### Hybrid Machine Learning (HML) Model Mapping

The **Hybrid Machine Learning (HML) model** combines **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for energy demand prediction and **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** for real-time decision-making. This approach ensures both **predictive planning** and **optimal real-time adjustments** to minimize energy costs.

**HML Breakdown:**
- **RNN (LSTM/GRU):** Predicts household energy demand based on historical usage patterns.
- **MILP:** Optimizes device operations based on electricity rates, demand, and constraints.
- **Data Inputs:** IoT device power usage, historical energy trends, real-time electricity pricing, and weather conditions.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The **UEMS database** is structured to store user settings, energy usage logs, device configurations, and optimization outputs.

**Key Entities:**
- **Users**: Stores login credentials and user preferences.
- **Devices**: Contains details about connected IoT and non-IoT devices.
- **Energy Logs**: Tracks historical energy consumption.
- **Optimization Results**: Stores recommendations from the HML model.
